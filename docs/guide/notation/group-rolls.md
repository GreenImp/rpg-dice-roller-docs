# Group Rolls (Coming soon)

::: tip Coming soon
We're working on group rolls, which will allow you to carry out actions on a collection of rolls.

It will allow things like this:

```
// roll the sub-rolls, total their values, and only keep the highest two
{4d10, 5d6, 2d10}k2: {[8, 1, 4, 1], [1, 5, 1, 5, 3], ([6, 3])d} = 29
```
